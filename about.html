    <h2>Barriers in Tech</h2>

        <p>
            But before even starting college, I knew of the lack of number of women in college CS programs and in tech
            in
            general. I was warned by family, friends, and frankly, professionals alike, that there were so few women in
            this
            field and that I would often find myself to be the only one at the table who looked like me. When I started
            college, it was more important than ever to me to create a path for other women who were also entering this
            world of tech and discovering their love for CS. I wanted to provide the same encouragement and support that
            Girls Who Code provided me when I first began. Thus, I founded a chpater of Girls Who Code College Loops, a
            program that aims to support college women in computer science. I wanted the club
            to be welcoming to everyone, regardless of one's major or tech background. I created this club in the hopes
            of
            empowering technologists who don't typically see themselves represented in tech but are fueled by their
            passion
            for tech.
