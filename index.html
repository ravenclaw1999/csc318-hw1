    <h1>Why I love computer science</h1>
    <i><b>by Samira C</b></i>
    <h2>My introduction to tech</h2>
    <div>
        <p>My introduction to the world of technology was with <b>Girls Who Code</b> in high school when I was a student
            in
            the <i>GWC Summer Immersion Program</i>. Prior to this summer, I never envisioned myself in tech. However,
            learning
            alongside a
            classroom of other women, many of whom were also beginning their computer science journeys, I felt empowered
            and
            discovered very quickly that tech was for me. Through this program, I met one of my cherished mentors, and
            she
            is a big reason for why I am still in tech. Being in an <b>inclusive and welcoming environment</b> is
            crucial,
            especially when tackling new fields such as like AI and machine learning. Being a part of this supportive
            environment will make the biggest difference.

        <h2>What is exciting to me in tech</h2>

        <p>In many of my previous internships and projects, I have mainly focused on web development, which I have also
            loved. However, I want to make a transition to the data science/AI/ML path. To me, computer science has
            endless possibilities, and these fields in particular get me excited to learn and explore!
            <br><br>

            Though AI sounds exciting and full of so many possibilities, it is a little scary. The reason for this is
            that it seems machine learning researchers themselves don't completely understand the inner workings of how
            and why a model works the way it does. I think this is quite alarming and tells us that us as technologists
            need to step back and evaluate the true power of what we are creating. AI is great and all, but to what
            extent should we limit it so that it doesn't lose our control and oversight? It's alarming to hear about
            many companies firing their AI ethics and implicit bias researchers. As these technologies are continuing to
            become integrated into our everyday lives (they already have been for some time), we need to analyze whether
            these technologies work for everybody or just the select few. As someone entering this space, I want to
            ensure that we as a society don't fail to recognize the importance of creating AI that is ethical and works
            for all. I am truly excited to learn and delve deeper into AI and machine learning, and ultimately
            contribute to the future of technology.

            biases within AI: <a target="_blank"
